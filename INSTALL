Installation Instructions
-------------------------

If they aren't already installed, you will need the following modules:
  sudo cpan Module::Install
  sudo cpan Test::Exception
  sudo cpan Any::Moose
  sudo cpan Class::Method::Modifiers
  sudo cpan Tie::IxHash (most db commands, MongoDBensure_index)

A couple methods (that you might not run into) require:
  sudo cpan boolean (MongoDB::Collection::ensure_index)
  sudo cpan Digest::MD5 (MongoDB::Connection::authenticate)

Packages needed for different types:
  dates: DateTime
  booleans: boolean


Then do:
  $ perl Makefile.PL
  $ make
  $ make test
  $ make install


Big Endian Machines
-------------------

MongoDB cannot run on a big endian machine, but the driver can.  If you have a
little endian machine available, you can connect to that remotely and develop on
your big endian machine.  

To run the tests using a remote database, make sure mongod is running on it and 
then do:

  $ MONGOD=example.com make test

where example.com is the hostname for your machine running mongod.  The driver 
will use the value of $ENV{MONGOD} as the host if you provide it, otherwise it 
will try to connect to localhost.
