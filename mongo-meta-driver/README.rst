MongoDB Meta Driver Project
===========================

The MongoDB Meta Driver is an attempt to formally specify the client
library interface for MongoDB. Eventually the documents and this
specification will enhance and replace the current `MongoDB
driver writing tutorial <http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Writing+Drivers+and+Tools>`_.

In the mean time consider *all* content in this repository incomplete,
draft, and non-final.
