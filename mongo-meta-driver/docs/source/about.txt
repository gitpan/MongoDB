About the MongoDB Meta Driver
=============================

The Meta Driver
---------------

The MongoDB Meta Driver is an attempt to specify the behavior,
operation, and implementation of the MongoDB client interface, in an
intentional, language-independent, and behavior-driven approach.

The Documentation

These documents reflect version |version| of the meta-driver.

This edition of the meta-driver reflects the "|branch|" branch as of
the "|commit|" revision. This branch is explicitly accessible via
"|hardlink|" and you can always reference the commit of the current
manual in the :hardlink:`release.txt` file.

The latest version of the meta-driver is always available at
"http://docs.mongodb.org/meta-driver/latest/."
